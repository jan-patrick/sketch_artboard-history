# artboard-history

Switch faster between your latest used Artboards inside Sketch

Limitations (for now):
- Switch between two Artboards (opt + cmd + a), can be done infinitely.
- only works within one document (the history is overwritten when opening another document / works with the current used document only).

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/jan-patrick/sketch_artboard-history/issues) if something does not work probably or if you have a feature request.

Shortcut:
opt (⌥) + cmd (⇧) + a (A)
